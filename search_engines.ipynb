The evolution of generative AI has mirrored that of computers, albeit on a dramatically accelerated timeline. Massive, centrally operated mainframe computers from a few players gave way to smaller, more efficient machines accessible to enterprises and research institutions. In the decades that followed, incremental advances yielded home computers that hobbyists could tinker with. In time, powerful personal computers with intuitive no-code interfaces became ubiquitous.

      "Extracted text: The Biggest AI Trends In The 10 Years  Although I like to write about future predictions for the world of technology and business, I’m usually focused on what’s coming up in the next five years. That’s because the companies I advise on data and tech strategy want to know what they should do now – or very soon – to leverage the opportunities of digital transformation. But it’s also worth taking a longer view. I believe that in 10 years’ time, the AI that’s a part of everyday life will be as far evolved from today’s AI as today’s internet is from the internet of the early days. In his excellent book The Coming Wave, Mustafa Suleyman notes that every wave of technology-driven change – from the combustion engine to the internet – has revolutionized society in a shorter time span than the previous wave. So, I don’t think we’ll have to wait 30 or even 20 years until AI is utterly engrained in all aspects of life. Instead, let’s look ahead just 10 years to 2034. Halfway through the next decad\n",
